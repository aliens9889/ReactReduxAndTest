# ReactRedusAndTest

This project it to understand better React, Redux and now test.
This is a tutorial from Stephen Grider. you could check his tutorial hear 

Interested in learning [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

Now the difference about the original tutorial is that I'm going to use yarn instead npm, but you could use whatever you want.

To run the project first you have install the dependecies

```
yarn install
```

To run the project 
```
yarn start
```

To run and watch the changes about test
```
yarn run test:watch
```

The project is a textarea that once you pressed the submit button it will create a list with the comments that you submitted.
